 ![](mfm_slicer.png)
 - Print the parts with suports.
 - Mount the "flipper" on the servo shaft.
 - Insert the servo into the holder. If is too loosen, add some tape to the sides of the servo to make it thicker so it sits tightly.
 - Align the optics carrier of the TFR90/M with the flipper position and slide in the assembly.
 - Tighten the screw on the side of the TFR90/M. (Use the provided allen key)
 - Try it and correct the flipper position/direction if necesary.
